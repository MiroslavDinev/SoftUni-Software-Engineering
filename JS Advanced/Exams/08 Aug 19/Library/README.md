Problem 3. Library
==================

**class** Library {  
*// TODO: implement this class...*  
}

### Your Task

### Write a Library class which supports the described functionality below.

### Functionality

#### constructor()

Receives **1** parameters at initialization of the class (**libraryName**),
where library name is a **string.**

Should have at least these **3** properties:

-   **libraryName** - **string** (should be the same as the received
    **libraryName**)

-   **subscribers** - **empty array**

-   **subscriptionTypes** - object with properties **normal, special** and
    **vip**

    -   The number of books that a person with **normal** subscription can
        receive is equal to the **length of the libraryName**

    -   The number of books that a person with **special** subscription can
        receive is equal to the **length of the libraryName multiplied by 2
        (libraryName \* 2)**

    -   A person with **vip** subscription can receive unlimited
        (**Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER**) amount of books

#### subscribe(name, type)

This **function** receives **2 string** parameters - **name** and **type**

-   If the given subscription **type** is not **normal**, **special** or
    **vip**, a new error should be **thrown** with the following message: **"The
    type {type} is invalid"**

-   If the person **is not subscribed**, you should make **new subscriber
    object** with properties

    -   **name** (the subscriber name)

    -   **type** (the subscription type)

    -   **books** (an empty array by default)

and add it to the library subscribers' array.

-   If there is a person with that **name** in the **subscribers** list, you
    should just **change** his subscription **type** with the given type.

*This function should return the current subscriber.*

#### unsubscribe(name)

This **function** receives **1** parameter **name** and should **unsubscribe**
an **already subscribed** person in the library (**remove** the person with the
**given name** from the **subscriber's property**).

-   If there **is no subscriber** with that **name,** a **new error** should be
    **thrown** with the following message: "**There is no such subscriber as
    {name}**"

-   If **subscribers property** contains a person with the **given name**, that
    person should be **removed** from the array.

*This function should return the library's subscribers list*

#### receiveBook(subscriberName, bookTitle, bookAuthor)

This function receives **3** parameters **(subscriberName, bookTitle** and
**bookAuthor**) and should **add** a book to the **subscriber's** book list.

-   If there is **no** such subscriber in the **subscriber's** array, a new
    error should be **thrown** with the following message: **"There is no such
    subscriber as {name}"**

-   If there is a subscriber with that name you should **check** his
    subscription **type**:

    -   If his subscription type **allows** him to **receive** more book you
        should **add** a new **book object** with properties **title** and
        **author** to his books array

    -   Otherwise a new error should be thrown, with the following message:

>   **"You have reached your subscription limit {subTypeLimit}!"**

*This function should return the subscriber with the given name.*

#### showInfo ()

This function should **return a string with all the subscribers** with their
books joined by (**", "**) in the following format:

>   **"Subscriber: {subscriberName}, Type: {subscriptionType}\\n**

>   **Received books: {title} by {author}, {title2} by {author2}â€¦"**

If the subscriber's property in the Library is empty just **return** the
following string:

**"{libraryName} has no information about any subscribers"**

### Submission

Submit only your **Library class.**

### Examples

This is an example how the code is **intended to be used**:
