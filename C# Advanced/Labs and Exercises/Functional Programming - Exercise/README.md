Action Point
------------

Write a program that reads a collection of **strings** from the console and then
**prints** them onto the **console**. Each name should be printed on a **new
line**. Use **Action\<T\>**.

### Examples

| **Input**          | **Output**         |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Pesho Gosho Adasha | Pesho Gosho Adasha |

Knights of Honor
----------------

Write a program that reads a collection of **names** as **strings** from the
**console** then appends “**Sir**” in front of every name and **prints** it back
onto the **console**. Use **Action\<T\>**.

### Examples

| **Input**                       | **Output**                                      |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Pesho Gosho Adasha StanleyRoyce | Sir Pesho Sir Gosho Sir Adasha Sir StanleyRoyce |

Custom Min Function
-------------------

Write a simple program that reads from the **console** a set of **integers** and
**prints** back onto the **console** the **smallest number** from the
collection. Use **Func\<T, T\>**.

### Examples

| **Input**      | **Output** |
|----------------|------------|
| 1 4 3 2 1 7 13 | 1          |

Find Evens or Odds
------------------

You are given a lower and an upper bound for a range of integer numbers. Then a
command specifies if you need to list all even or odd numbers in the given
range. Use **Predicate\<T\>**.

### Examples

| **Input**  | **Output**        |
|------------|-------------------|
| 1 10 odd   | 1 3 5 7 9         |
| 20 30 even | 20 22 24 26 28 30 |

Applied Arithmetics
-------------------

Write a program that executes some mathematical operations on a given
collection. On the **first line** you are given **a list of numbers**. On the
**next lines** you are passed **different commands** that you need to **apply to
all numbers** in the list: "add" -\> add 1 to each number; "multiply" -\>
multiply each number by 2; "subtract" -\> subtract 1 from each number; “print”
-\> print the collection. The input will end with an "**end**" command. Use
functions.

### Examples

| **Input**                        | **Output** |
|----------------------------------|------------|
| 1 2 3 4 5 add add print end      | 3 4 5 6 7  |
| 5 10 multiply subtract print end | 9 19       |

Reverse and Exclude
-------------------

Write a program that reverses a collection and removes elements that are
divisible by a given integer **n**. Use predicates/functions.

### Examples

| **Input**           | **Output**  |
|---------------------|-------------|
| 1 2 3 4 5 6 2       | 5 3 1       |
| 20 10 40 30 60 50 3 | 50 40 10 20 |

Predicate for Names
-------------------

Write a program that filters a list of names according to their length. On the
first line you will be given integer **n** representing name length. On the
second line you will be given some names as strings separated by space. Write a
function that prints only the names whose length is **less than or equal** to
**n**.

### Examples

| **Input**                     | **Output**   |
|-------------------------------|--------------|
| 4 Kurnelia Qnaki Geo Muk Ivan | Geo Muk Ivan |
| 4 Karaman Asen Kiril Yordan   | Asen         |

Custom Comparator
-----------------

Write a custom comparator that sorts all even numbers before all odd ones in
ascending order. Pass it to an Array.Sort() function and print the result. Use
functions.

### Examples

| **Input**   | **Output**  |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1 2 3 4 5 6 | 2 4 6 1 3 5 |
| \-3 2       | 2 -3        |

List of Predicates
------------------

Find all numbers in the range 1...N that are divisible by the numbers of a given
sequence. On the first line you will be given an integer **N** – which is the
end of the range. On the second line you will be given a sequence of integers
which are the dividers. Use predicates/functions.

### Examples

| **Input**     | **Output**      |
|---------------|-----------------|
| 10 1 1 1 2    | 2 4 6 8 10      |
| 100 2 5 10 20 | 20 40 60 80 100 |

Predicate Party!
----------------

Ivancho’s parents are on a vacation for the holidays and he is planning an epic
party at home. Unfortunately, his organizational skills are next to
non-existent, so you are given the task to help him with the reservations.

On the **first line** you get a **list with all the people** that are coming. On
the **next lines**, until you get the **"Party!" command**, you may be asked to
**double** or **remove all the people** that apply to given **criteria**. There
are **three different criteria**: 1. everyone that has his **name starting**
with a **given string**; 2. everyone that has a **name ending** with a **given
string**; 3. everyone that has a **name** with a **given length**.

Finally **print all the guests** who are going to the party **separated by** “,
” and then **add the ending** “are going to the party!”. If there are **no
guests** going to the party print “Nobody is going to the party!”. See the
examples below:

### Examples

| **Input**                                                     | **Output**                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Pesho Misho Stefan Remove StartsWith P Double Length 5 Party! | Misho, Misho, Stefan are going to the party!       |
| Pesho Double StartsWith Pesh Double EndsWith esho Party!      | Pesho, Pesho, Pesho, Pesho are going to the party! |
| Pesho Remove StartsWith P Party!                              | Nobody is going to the party!                      |

Party Reservation Filter Module
-------------------------------

You need to implement a filtering module to a party reservation software. First,
to the Party Reservation Filter Module (PRFM for short) is **passed a list**
with invitations. Next the PRFM receives a **sequence of commands** that specify
whether you need to add or remove a given filter.

Each PRFM command is in the given format **{command;filter type;filter
parameter}**

You can receive the following PRFM commands: "**Add filter**", "**Remove
filter**" or "**Print**". The possible PRFM filter types are: "**Starts with**",
"**Ends with**", "**Length**" and "**Contains**". All PRFM filter parameters
will be a string (or an integer only for the “**Length”** filter). Each command
will be valid e.g. you won’t be asked to remove a non-existent filter.

The input will **end** with a "**Print**" command after which you should print
all the party-goers that are left after the filtration. See the examples below:

### Examples

| **Input**                                                                                            | **Output** |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Pesho Misho Slav Add filter;Starts with;P Add filter;Starts with;M Print                             | Slav       |
| Pesho Misho Jica Add filter;Starts with;P Add filter;Starts with;M Remove filter;Starts with;M Print | Misho Jica |

Inferno III
-----------

On the **first line** you are given **a sequence of numbers**. Each number is a
gem and the **value** represents its **power**. On the next lines, until you
receive the "**Forge**" command, you will be receiving commands in the following
format: **{command;filter type;filter parameter}.**

**Commands** can be: "**Exclude**", "**Reverse**" or "**Forge**". The possible
filter types are: "**Sum Left**", "**Sum Right**" and "**Sum Left Right**". All
filter **parameters** will be **an integer**.

"**Exclude**" marks a gem for **exclusion** from the set if it meets a **given
condition**. "**Reverse**" **deletes** a previous **exclusion**.

"**Sum Left**" tests if a gem’s **power added** to the gem standing to **its
left** gives a **certain value**. "**Sum Right**" is the same but looks to a
gem’s **right peer**. "**Sum Left Right**" sums the gems power with **both** its
**left** and **right** neighbors. If a gem has **no neighbor** to its right or
to its left (first or last element), then simply **add 0** to the gem.

Note that **changes** to the sequence **are applied** only **after forging**.
This means that the gems are fixed at their positions and **every function**
occurs on the **original set**, so every gems power is considered, no matter if
it is marked to be excluded or not. To better understand the problem, see the
examples below:

### Examples

| **Input**                                                   | **Output** | **Comments**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 2 3 4 5 Exclude;Sum Left;1 Exclude;Sum Left Right;9 Forge | 2 4        | 1. Marks for exclusion all gems for which the sum with neighbors to their left equals 1, e.g. 0 + **1** = 1 2. Marks for exclusion all gems for which the sum with neighbors to their left and their right equals 9, e.g. 2 + **3** + 4 = 9 4 + **5** + 0 = 9 |
| 1 2 3 4 5 Exclude;Sum Left;1 Reverse;Sum Left;1 Forge       | 1 2 3 4 5  | 1. Marks for exclusion all gems for which the sum with their gem peers to the left equals 1, e.g. 0 + 1 = 1 2. Reverses the previous exclusion.                                                                                                               |

TriFunction
-----------

Write a program that traverses a collection of names and returns the **first
name** whose sum of characters is **equal** to or **larger** than a given number
**N,** which will be given on the first line. Use a function that **accepts
another function** as one of its parameters. Start off by building a regular
function to hold the basic logic of the program. Something along the lines of
**Func\<string, int, bool\>**. Afterwards create your main function which should
accept the first function as one of its parameters.
