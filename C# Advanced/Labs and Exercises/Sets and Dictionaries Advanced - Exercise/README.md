Unique Usernames
----------------

On the first line you will be given an integer **N**. On the next **N** lines
you will receive one username per line. Write a simple program that reads from
the console a sequence of **N** usernames and keeps a collection only of the
unique ones. Print the collection on the console in order of insertion:

### Examples

| **Input**                                       | **Output**                     |

Sets of Elements
----------------

On the first line you are given the length of two sets **n** and **m**. On the
next **n** + **m** lines there are **n** numbers that are in the first set and
**m** numbers that are in the second one. Find all non-repeating elements that
appear in both of them and print those from the **n** set.

Set with length n = 4: {1, **3**, **5**, 7}

Set with length m = 3: {**3**, 4, **5**}

Set that contains all repeating elements -\> {**3**, **5**}

### Examples

| **Input**         | **Output** |
|-------------------|------------|
| 4 3 1 3 5 7 3 4 5 | 3 5        |
| 2 2 1 3 1 5       | 1          |

Periodic Table
--------------

You are given an **n** number of chemical compounds joined with space (' '). You
need to keep track of all chemical elements used in the compounds and at the end
print all unique ones in ascending order:

### Examples

| **Input**                  | **Output**          |
|----------------------------|---------------------|
| 4 Ce O Mo O Ce Ee Mo       | Ce Ee Mo O          |

Wardrobe
--------

You just bought a new wardrobe. The weird thing about it is that it came
prepackaged with a big box of clothes (just like those refrigerators, which ship
with free beer inside them)! So, you’ll need to find something to wear.

### Input

On the first line of the input, you will receive **n** – the **number of lines**
of clothes, which came prepackaged for the wardrobe.

On the next **n** lines, you will receive the clothes for each color in the
format:

-   “**{color} -\> {item1},{item2},{item3}…**”

If a color is added a **second** time, **add all items** from it and **count**
the **duplicates**.

**Finally**, you will receive the **color** and **item** of the clothing, that
you need to look for.

### Output

Go through all the **colors** of the clothes and print them in the following
format:

| **{color}** clothes: \* **{item1}** - **{count}** \* **{item2}** - **{count}** \* **{item3}** - **{count}** … \* **{itemN}** - **{count}** |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|


If the **color** lines up with the **clothing item**, print “**(found!)**”
alongside the item. See the examples to better understand the output.

### Examples

\*The V-Logger
--------------

As you know vlogging (making short videos instead of written blogposts) is the
new super trend among young people. You have always been very passionate about
vloggers and their videos and now you decided to create a website, called "The
V-Logger", so to rank the most followed vloggers. Good thing that you are also a
programmer, so you can easily track what vloggers do.

You need to implement functionality that allows **vloggers to register** in your
website. Note that, every vlogger must have a **unique vloggername**, so to be
recognizable by his followers.

**Vloggers** also like to **follow other vloggers**, so that they can see
immediately when a new video is posted.

A vlogger **can follow as many other vloggers as he wants**, but he **cannot**
follow **himself** or follow someone he is **already a follower** of.

### Input

The **input** will come as e sequence of strings, where each string will
represent a **valid** command. The commands will be presented in the following
format:

-   "**{vloggername}**" **joined The V-Logger** – a vlogger got registered into
    your website.

    -   Vloggernames **consist of only one word**.

    -   If the **given vloggername is already taken ignore that command.**

-   "**{vloggername} followed {vloggername}**" – The first vlogger followed the
    second vlogger.

    -   If **any** of the **given vlogernames does not exist** in the log
        **ignore that command.**

-   **"Statistics" -** Upon receiving this command you have to print a statistic
    about the registered vloggers in **"The V-Logger".**

### Output

-   On the first line you have to print **the total amount of vloggers** using
    “The V-Logger” in format:

**"The V-Logger has a total of {registered vloggers} vloggers in its logs."**

-   Then you have to find most famous vlogger (the vlogger with the most
    followers). He should be printed along with **his followers**, in the
    following format:

"**1. {vlogger} : {followers} followers, {vloggers he is a follower of}
following**

**\*** {follower1}

\* {follower2} ... "

-   If more than one vloggers have the same number of followers, you find **the
    one following less people**

-   The **followers** should be printed in **lexicographical order**.

-   If the vlogger has **no followers**, print only the **first line.**

-   Last print **all other vloggers**, ordered by **number of followers
    (descending)** and **number of followings (ascending)** in the following
    format:

"**{No}. {vlogger} : {followers} followers, {vloggers he is a follower of}
following"**

### Constraints

-   There will be no invalid input.

-   There will be no situation where two vloggers have equal amount of followers
    and equal amount of followings

-   The subscribers will be strings.

-   Allowed time/memory: **100ms/16MB**.

### Examples

| **Input**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | **Output**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

\*Ranking
---------

Here comes the final and the most interesting part – the Final ranking of the
candidate-interns. The final ranking is determined by the points of the
interview tasks and from the exams in SoftUni. Here is your final task. You will
receive some lines of input in the format **“{contest}:{password for contest}”**
until you receive **“end of contests”**. Save that data because **you will need
it later**. After that you will receive other type of inputs in format
**“{contest}=\>{password}=\>{username}=\>{points}”** until you receive **“end of
submissions”**. Here is what you need to do.

-   Check if the **contest is valid (if you received it in the first type of
    input)**

-   Check if the **password is correct for the given contest**

-   Save the user with the contest they take part in **(a user can take part in
    many contests)** and the points the user has in the given contest. If you
    receive the **same contest and the same user update the points only if the
    new ones are more than the older ones.**

At the end you have to print the info for the user with the **most points** in
the format **“Best candidate is {user} with total {total points} points.”**.
After that print **all students ordered by their names**. **For each user print
each contest with the points in descending order**. See the examples.

### Input

-   strings in format **“{contest}:{password for contest}”** until the **“end of
    contests”** command. There will be no case with two equal contests

-   strings in format **“{contest}=\>{password}=\>{username}=\>{points}”** until
    the **“end of submissions”** command.

-   **There will be no case with 2 or more users with same total points!**

### Output

-   On the first line print the best user in format **“Best candidate is {user}
    with total {total points} points.”.**

-   Then print all students ordered as mentioned above in format:

>   **{user1 name}**

>   **\# {contest1} -\> {points}**

>   **\# {contest2} -\> {points}**

>   **{user2 name}**

>   **…**

### Constraints

-   the strings may contain any ASCII character except from **(:, =, \>)**

-   the numbers will be in range **[0 - 10000]**

-   second input is always valid

### Examples

| **Input**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | **Output**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
